# MinGLcraft
I am going pick my first opengl project to be..... minecraft. I think I am insane.. or atleast I will be after this. 
Though I have made this repository... lets see if I commit to it and actually perform this insane task.
This will be a.... journey of epic proportions that will most probably take atleast a year or more. LETS START!! (only after my semester exams ofcourse. I too want to get a degree). 
I will be making this Fedora.

### Setting Up OpenGL in Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install mesa-libGL mesa-libGL-devel freeglut freeglut-devel glew-devel
```
